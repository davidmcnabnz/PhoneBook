Changelog for phonebook

06-Jan-2004 build 011

  * updated doco with makechaff command
  
  * Updated the 'fuse' filesystem code (from avf.sf.net cvs), to take advantage
    of 'fusermount -d devicepath' feature, which allows the phonebook physical
    datastore location to be written to the mount tab - simplifying the required
    syntax in /etc/fstab

05-Jan-2004 build 010

  * added 'makechaff' command for adding random chaff to filesystem (which
    adds the plausible deniability)

04-Jan-2004 build 009

  * various critical bugfixes
  
03-Jan-2004 build 008

  * fixed critical layermap writing bug (which was only affecting python2.2 users

27-Dec-2003 build 007

  * Various tidy-ups

25-Dec-2003 build 006

  * Implemented fixed file sizes
     - all files smaller than a given size get padded out

     - all files larger than a given size get broken up into
       a linked list of files

     - upon mounting, and with all writes, files in the physical datastore have
       a random timestamp applied to them

     - this means that all files in the physical store, regardless of whether
       they are layermaps, inode files or inode content files, will all be of
       the same length, which will further complicate the task of anyone trying
       to crack the fs

23-Dec-2003 build 005
  
  * pulled a bunch of bugs
  * fixed build for fuse python module
