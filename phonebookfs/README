README file for the PhoneBook filesystem.

PhoneBook is an encyrypted filesystem that builds on the
innovative concepts of the now-defunct 'Rubberhose' filesystem.

As with Rubberhose, PhoneBook offers encryption with plausible
deniability, but aims to be vastly easier to build, install and
deploy.

Features of PhoneBook:
    
    - multi-layered filesystem, whereby you can open up any combination
      of layers you choose, in any order, by submitting a combination
      of passphrases.
    - you can create 'layer stacks' which show different versions of the
      filesystem, with different combinations and versions of files,
      to different users
    - chaffing adds the deniability - through generation of chaff layers,
      which are cryptographically identical to regular layers, no attacker
      can determine exactly how many actual layers there are

To build and install PhoneBook, please carefully read the instructions in
the INSTALL file.
