The best way to install this python FUSE module is:
 1. make sure the rest of FUSE (incl libfuse.a) has built successfully
 2. type 'python setup.py build'
 3. if all has gone ok, become root and type 'python setup.py install'

That way, the FUSE python modules will be built against the correct version
of python and installed in your system-wide python directory. This will allow
your filesystem script to find them, no matter where it's residing.
